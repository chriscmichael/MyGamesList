1/4 Wrote User Stories and added to Gitlab issues
Worked on FastAPI setup

1/5 set up games models with Claudia and created first test data in Fast API GUI, troubleshooted Mongo express network issue

1/7 pair programmed on models and routers, played with FastAPI swagger

1/13 still working on models and routers trying to get back end finished and understand jwtdown authentication

1/19 spent a lot of time troubleshooting git problems, working on account front end

1/20 trying to figure out how to display account with filter

1/23 completely stuck on trying to get current user from account token

1/27 I guess I better write a more detailed account. I know this is not how the journal is supposed to go, but the first two and a half weeks of this project were very complicated for me. I had to learn about FastAPI and MongoDB while also trying to wrap my head around some huge API calls and all the transformations necessary to get that data into our own database in a workable form. In addition to pair programming, I spent a lot of time reading, watching videos, and experimenting. Another aspect was that we were learning how to collaborate with git and gitlab, and I had some very frustrating experiences trying to navigate merges until I finally got comfortable. All very valuable, but not much to show for it. Once we got to front end, things seemed to move a little more smoothly, but I got completely stuck on a problem that I didnâ€™t think would be so difficult and ended up spending days tearing out my hair, trying to modify models, queries, routers, and react logic to make it work, before finally working it out with the help of Riley, Will and Sarah as well as my teammates. I was not a huge contributor to the codebase, but I was in it every day, fixing small bugs and googling a lot. I would say the project was more helpful to me than I was to this team, which had some very strong programmers.
