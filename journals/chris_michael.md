    today i paired with garrett. we basically worked on a git issue that culminated in me deleting my branch and cloning down our working branch. we have a file called "api" with our router and query files. i had initially put those in one called fast-api or something of that nature. Basically each time i tried to merge or get rid of the file it would come back into my file tree. after that was solved we got vs code live share to work that was my ah ha moment for the day.
