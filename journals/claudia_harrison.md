We decided to make a website that keeps tracks of games you've played or want to play, simialr to My Anime List. For our primary models, were going to make a User, List, and Game model, with the game data imported from an outside API. For stretch goals, we we are also eventually considering making a Review or Follower model. We also made a render.com account. Garret found a way to get our game data from igdb.com as well as price data from arethereanydeals.com.  We can pull images, genre, and suggested games. Instructors approved our models and suggested us to work on the core three for now.

Started on the wireframes for the site and decided on color scheme and logo. The log will be a little green controller and we chose the color scheme from those colros. We are also thinking of makeing the background a randomized game screenshot or something like that.

Finished the wireframes and decided what we want the nav bar, main page and various views to look like. Also added success and fail pages for various actions and what pages the user will be redirected to. Used the logo and color scheme we selected yesterday.

Presented wireframes to instructors. Got advice on color palette. Discussed how to split up project work. Do we all want to work on a part of the backend? Should we do one model per team member. We all want to be familiar with FastAPI and MongoDB so we are thinking we should all have some responsibility for the backend.
